## Scripts and code

<list any software scripts/code contained in the repository and a description of their purpose.>

USGS_dataRetrieval.R contains the script used for pulling relevant river gage data from the USGS website (using the dataRetrieval R package).

USGS_dataProcessing.R contains the script used for processing the raw data. The data was processed by removing irrelevant
columns, selecting time range of interest, renaming columns, and setting correct classes for variables.

## Quality assurance/quality control
